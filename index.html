                <h3>About Dr. Demetry</h3>
                <p>Dr. Demetry graduated from the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in 2012 where he earned several
                    academic awards. In 2014, he joined the team at the University Health Network (UHN) Comprehensive
                    Integrated Pain Program at The Toronto Rehabilitation Institute. In this hospital setting, Demetry
                    works with a team of physicians, nurses, occupational therapists and physiotherapists to
                    <span class="emphasis">diagnose
                        and manage patients suffering from persistent pain</span>. He later joined the team at the Pain
                    & Wellness
                    Centre in Vaughan ON, where they provide interdisciplinary pain management to patients of all walks
                    of life, including those suffering from persistent pain.</p>
                <p>Dr. Demetry was recruited in 2016 by provincially-funded agencies to <span class="emphasis">educate Healthcare
                        practitioners</span>
                    in their communities on the topic of persistent pain. He continues to teach his course Diagnosis and
                    Management of Chronic Pain for Healthcare Providers across Canada. Dr. Demetry also lectures at the
                    Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in the department of Graduate Studies on the topic of chronic
                    pain, and supervises residents in the hospital environment learning how to manage chronic pain.</p>
                <p>In 2017 he was graciously awarded the <span class="emphasis">Exemplary Service Award</span> by the Ontario
                    Chiropractic Association
                    in 2019. When he is not working, Dr. Demetry spends most of his free time with his wife and son,
                    making his wife cringe with his horrible dad puns.</p>

                <p>I was referred to Dr. Demetry at the Pain & Wellness Centre for treatment of chronic headaches with
                    which I have struggled for years.
                    I was so impressed with every person on my care team and how personable they were and how easy it
                    was to communicate with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Demetry is an outstanding chiropractor who exceeds expectations. He has a unique skill set and
                    approach to patient care. Demetry is very <span class="emphasis">supportive and motivational </span>and teaches you to believe in
                    yourself again so you can achieve your goals, both physically and mentally. This is especially
                    important in pain management. He is <span class="emphasis">open and honest </span>which allows you, as a patient, to trust in him,
                    furthering your success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Demetry is a wealth of information which allows you to progress through your life with
                    confidence and the ability to navigate through pain independently.
                    I am forever grateful that I had the good fortune of working with Demetry and the Pain & Wellness
                    team.

                <p>
                    I suffered from chronic pain for ten years.
                    During that decade, I saw scores of doctors, physios, osteopaths, and any other medical professional
                    that I thought might be able to help me live comfortably again.
                    I gave up hope of ever returning to an active lifestyle.
                    I saw Demetry while he was working at the Pain & Wellness Centre in Vaughan, Ontario.
                    He listened to every word I said and <span class="emphasis"> focussed his efforts on trying to find what everyone else had
                    missed.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    During our first session, he gave me a different diagnosis than I had previously received.
                    With that as a baseline, he worked to resolve the re-identified problem and even more importantly,
                    he helped me work to regain my fitness and active lifestyle.
                    He’s approachable and has a sense of humour too.
